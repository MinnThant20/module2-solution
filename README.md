			<h2>Informations About The Character</h2> 

			<p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">The Batman Who Laughs is an evil version of Bruce Wayne and a major antagonist in the DC Universe. He appears as the secondary antagonist of Dark Nights: Metal, one of the two main antagonists (alongside Perpetua) of Dark Nights: Death Metal, the titular main antagonist of The Batman Who Laughs seven-issue miniseries and one of the two main antagonists (alongside Lex Luthor) of the Year of the Villain saga.

            He is a "Jokerized" version of Batman who originated from the Dark Multiverse. He is the team leader of the Dark Knights and their goal was to help their master Barbatos plunge the entire Multiverse into complete and utter chaos and darkness. This course of action makes themselves enemies of the Justice League. The Batman Who Laughs traces his origin to a different Earth, which had him actually slay his own version of the Joker. After gaining the powers of Doctor Manhattan via transferring his brain into an alternate Bruce Wayne known as Batmanhattan, he becomes a being of pure darkness with omnipotent power known as The Darkest Knight.</p>

            <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">The Batman Who Laughs has all the training, discipline, and experience of the Prime Earth Batman. In addition, he possesses information about the strengths and weaknesses of numerous superheroes and supervillains in the DC Universe, as he had already killed them in his own reality. He also has knowledge from various other worlds he has visited and can adapt to almost any situation.

            All of these factors. combined with the fact that those born in the Dark Multiverse are extremely resistant to attacks by those from the central Multiverse makes The Batman Who Laughs immensely dangerous. However, he possesses a couple of notable weaknesses. He is highly vulnerable to both Nth Metal and Element X. Also, despite how different he has become, Laughs is still Batman and can be caught off-guard by situations Batman is not prepared for such as Batman and Joker teaming up. This, along with his arrogance, means that surprise factors can lead to his defeat.

            It is revealed in The Batman Who Laughs miniseries that Laughs has the ability to sense people's urges, which can be used to find what he desires. However, he needs to wear a visor made of Dark Metal in order to focus his senses and pinpoint what he is searching for.

            After absorbing the powers of an alternate reality Doctor Manhattan and being reborn as the Darkest Knight, the Batman Who Laughs now has nigh-omnipotent powers at least on par with Manhattan - which easily ranks him one of DC's most powerful antagonists (since Manhattan was never truly defeated, simply convinced to alter his plans).</p>

            <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">The Batman Who Laughs was once much like Prime Earth's Batman except that he ended up killing his version of the Joker. After doing this, Bruce was exposed to a nano-toxin that slowly transformed him. It rewired his mind not only to think more like Joker but also twisted his moral core into something evil. However, despite these changes, Bruce still managed to retain the orderly and logical aspects of his mind as well as his highly keen and calculating intellect. Thus he became someone with Batman's tactical genius and combat training and Joker's lack of morality. He also has the latter's desire for chaos, and insanity.</p>
